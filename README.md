# ts-project-setup

My Standard setup for running TS Apps in browser.

1. Its just for TS, HTML, CSS with WebPack.
2. hot-loading for TS is working but for css you need to import that css file to TS so that the changes get detected (not the best method but it works)
3. HTML hot loading does not work at all.
